A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

### **Introduction to the Recipe Generation Program**

This program leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create customized recipes based on user queries. It combines document retrieval and text generation techniques to provide contextually relevant and creative recipes. By embedding user queries and searching a pre-built knowledge base, the program retrieves the most relevant recipe documents. These documents are then used to generate a new recipe, ensuring it meets the user's specified ingredients and preferences. **The program also includes error handling and filtering to exclude unwanted ingredients, making the recipe generation process both flexible and user-friendly.**
